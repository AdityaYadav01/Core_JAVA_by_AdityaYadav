    /*                                  PRINCIPLE OF OOPs
    *
    *
    *    1. Abstraction - It means hiding the internal details and showing only required things.
    *       Example - Consider a man driving a car, while driving he will be focusing on steering, gear, accelerator.
    *                 He doesn't require to know the internal mechanism.
    *
    *    2. Encapsulation - It is the process of grouping data in a single section.
    *        Example - Complete television is a single box where all the mechanism are hidden inside the box all over are capsuled.
    *
    *    3. Inheritance - It means designing an object or class by re-using the properties of existing class or object.
    *                     Inheritance is same as specialization.
    *         Example - An old style television is transformed with extra features like slim, smart television where it re-used the properties of old television.
    *
    *    4. Polymorphism - Polymorphism is the concept where we can perform single operation in different ways.
    *                      Polymorphism is same as generalization.
