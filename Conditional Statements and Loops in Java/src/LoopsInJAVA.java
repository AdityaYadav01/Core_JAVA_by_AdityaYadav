        *             for(intialization, condition, increment/decrement){

        *  2. While Loop - It is generally used when we don't know how many times loop iterate.
        *       Syntax:
        *               while(condition){
        *                            BODY

        *
        *  3. do while loop - It is used when we want to execute our statement at least one time.
        *        Syntax:
        *                do{
        *                   code to be executed;
        *                   update statement - increment/decrement
